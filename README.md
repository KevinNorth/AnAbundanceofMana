# An Abundance of Mana

The code I wrote and own in a Unity project I'm working on as a hobby. The project is a Slay the Spire-style deckbuilding roguelike.

I am primarily using PlasticSCM as my version control for this project. I'm hosting this part of the project on GitHub to put it into my portfolio. As a result, the commit history for this project isn't representative of how I typically use version control.

I'm not hosting the entire project on GitHub because I'm using commercial third-party packages that (very understandably) do not give me a license to share their code or other assets. Without being able to include those packages, the Unity scenes, prefabs and other assets aren't usable. If you would like to discuss the project with me, send me a message at kevinjamesnorth@outlook.com and I'll be happy to send you the whole Unity project!
